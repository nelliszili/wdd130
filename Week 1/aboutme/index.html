   </p>Hello everyone! My name is Nelli. I am originally from Hungary but I moved to the US a few years ago. I live in Northern California with my husband and our little kids. I love cooking, hiking and traveling as much as possible. I expect to learn so much new information in this class because this is my first time to take any IT class ever and I was always interested to learn more about it. I am really excited! <p>
