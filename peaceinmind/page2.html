    <p>Depression is one of the most common reasons why people seek counseling. 
        
        SO MANY PEOPLE JUST DON’T. GET. IT. 
        
        (Cue the “why don’t you just try…” refrain.)
        
        Fortunately, our therapists know what it’s like. We have our own lived experience with depression, or we have a lot of experience supporting clients or loved ones who have. We recognize that many of us will experience depression at some time in our lives, and we know that depression doesn’t have to take control forever. 
        
        THERE IS HOPE. 
        
        If you’ve been struggling with depression, read on or just reach out to talk more. We'd love to offer you support and tools.

                The heaviness starts to lift.<br>
                You understand what’s really going on.<br>
                You feel less alone.<br>
                You reconnect with yourself and others.<br>
                You begin to believe in a future again.<br>
                YOU’RE NOT ALONE. THIS CAN GET BETTER.
