    <p> Depression Counseling in Sacramento and Online in CA
        Depression is one of the most common reasons why people seek counseling. Depression can suck all the joy out of life, drain you of any energy or motivation, and leave you feeling like an empty shell of yourself. It can be truly hellish and soul-crushing. And, just as bad - 
        
        SO MANY PEOPLE JUST DON’T. GET. IT. 
        
        (Cue the “why don’t you just try…” refrain.)
        
        Fortunately, our therapists know what it’s like. We have our own lived experience with depression, or we have a lot of experience supporting clients or loved ones who have. We recognize that many of us will experience depression at some time in our lives, and we know that depression doesn’t have to take control forever. 
        
        THERE IS HOPE. 
        
        If you’ve been struggling with depression, read on or just reach out to talk more. We'd love to offer you support and tools.</p>
    <H1> SIGNS OF DEPRESSION</H1>
    <p>Depression can often be misunderstood by well-meaning friends, family, and even by those who suffer.  If you’ve ever had someone say, “Just get over it” or “Stop feeling sorry for yourself,” you know what we’re talking about. 

        We all know how to WebMD a condition, so let’s talk about how people usually describe being depressed. The first image that comes to mind is that antidepressant commercial from years ago with the blob. The poor little guy was so miserable and blob-like and just couldn’t enjoy or feel good about anything. Watching that commercial made us feel depressed too! 
        
        Some other ways we hear real people talk about depression:
        
        “I just don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t want to do anything.”
        
        “I cry a lot” (usually said with tears in their eyes).
        
        “I don’t have any energy.”
        
        “I feel empty, and I wonder, “What’s the point?”
        
         “I don’t care about things. I used to love to ________, but I don’t even care about that anymore.”
        
        “I just want to stop feeling this way.” 
        
        “It’s all I can do to drag myself out of bed in the morning.”
        
        “I’m stuck in a dark hole.”
        
        HOW THERAPY CAN HELP

        The heaviness starts to lift.
         That constant weight of sadness, fatigue, or numbness begins to ease, even if just a little at first.
        
        You understand what’s really going on.
         Instead of feeling stuck or blaming yourself, you gain clarity—and learn how to navigate the hard days with more confidence.
        
        You feel less alone.
         In therapy, you’re met with warmth, support, and zero judgment. You don’t have to carry it all by yourself anymore.
        
        You reconnect with yourself and others.
         Joy, motivation, and meaningful relationships start to return—at your own pace, in your own way.
        
        You begin to believe in a future again.
         That flicker of hope? It grows. And life starts to feel more possible, more peaceful, and more like you again.
        
        YOU’RE NOT ALONE. THIS CAN GET BETTER.</p>
