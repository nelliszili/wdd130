    <p> DOES THIS FEEL FAMILIAR?

        Your mind just won’t stop racing.
        Even when you try to unwind, your body stays on high alert.
        Social gatherings feel more like stress than fun — you're afraid of spiraling or snapping unexpectedly.
        You’re exhausted, on edge, and your concentration is shot.
        You’ve been trying to push through, hoping it’ll pass — but something inside you knows it’s time to reach out.
        Take a moment. Breathe. You’re not alone in this, and you don’t have to carry it by yourself.
        
        ANXIETY MAY BE CALLING THE SHOTS RIGHT NOW — BUT IT DOESN’T HAVE TO DEFINE YOUR STORY.</p>

    <p> The truth is, most of us have encountered trauma in some form. For many, the experience of Covid was a shared trauma. Others have lived through natural disasters, gun violence, systemic racism, sexism, homophobia, and various forms of discrimination and oppression. Then there are the deeply personal traumas — the heartbreak of lost relationships, emotional neglect, moments when we feared for our lives, or witnessing someone else in danger.

        BEING HUMAN MEANS FACING HARD THINGS.
        
        But here’s the hope: you don’t have to face them alone. We recognize how deeply these experiences can hurt — and we’re here to support you through the healing process.</p>
