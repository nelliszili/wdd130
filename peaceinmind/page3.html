    <p> DOES THIS SOUND LIKE YOU?

        You're constantly overthinking.
        
        You can’t relax—even when you try.
        
        You dread social events, worry about having another panic attack, and find yourself snapping at people for no reason.
        
        You’re drained, tense, and struggling to focus.
        
        You’ve tried powering through, but it’s not working. And deep down, you know it’s time to get support.
        
        Take a deep breath. You’re not alone. You don’t have to keep pushing through on your own.
        
        ANXIETY MIGHT BE RUNNING THE SHOW RIGHT NOW, BUT IT DOESN’T HAVE TO STAY THAT WAY.</p>

    <p> The reality is that most of us have experienced trauma in one way or another. Covid was been a collective trauma for many. Natural disasters, gun violence, racism, sexism, homophobia, discrimination, and oppression are certainly traumatic. Then, there are the innumerable personal traumas - devastating loss of relationships in our lives, not getting our needs met in the most important ways, experiencing something so scary that we feel like we might die or witnessing someone else in a life-threatening situation. 

        BEING HUMAN CAN BE TRAUMATIC. 
        
        But, the good news is - you’re not alone. We understand these deeply painful experiences, and we’re here to help.</p>
