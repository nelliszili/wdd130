    <p> I'm glad you're here.

        Life brings challenges, and sometimes we need a safe place to pause, reflect, and find a way forward. My goal as a counselor is to offer that space — a place where you feel seen, heard, and supported.
        
        Whether you're facing anxiety, relationship difficulties, grief, stress, or simply feeling stuck, you don’t have to go through it alone. Together, we can work toward healing, clarity, and growth.
        
        I offer individual, couple, and family counseling, and I tailor each session to your unique needs. My approach is compassionate, evidence-based, and grounded in respect for your personal values and life experiences.
        
        Your story matters. Let’s start where you are and take the next step — together.
